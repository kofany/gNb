## Prerequisites

- **Go Programming Language**: Version 1.23 or higher.
- **Access to an IRC Server**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to connect bots to your target IRC server.
- **Network Configuration**: If using custom vhosts, ensure they are properly configured on your network interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kofany/gNb.git
   cd gNb
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   go build -o gnb ./cmd/main.go
   ```

   This will create an executable named `gnb` in the project directory.

## Configuration

Before running the bot, you need to configure it properly.

1. **Configuration Files**
   The configuration files are located in the `configs` directory:

   - `config.yaml`: Main configuration file.
   - `owners.json`: List of bot owners who can execute commands.

2. **config.yaml Example**

   ```yaml
   global:
     log_level: debug  # Logging level: debug, info, warning, error
     ison_interval: 2  # Interval in seconds between ISON requests
     nick_api:
       url: 'https://i.got.al/words.php'
       max_word_length: 12
       timeout: 5  # Timeout for API requests in seconds
     max_nick_length: 14
     owner_command_prefixes:
       - "!"
       - "."
       - "@"
     reconnect_retries: 3
     reconnect_interval: 2
     mass_command_cooldown: 5

   bots:
     - server: irc.example.net
       port: 6667
       ssl: false
       vhost: 192.0.2.1  # Example IPv4
     - server: irc.example.net
       port: 6667
       ssl: false
       vhost: 2001:0db8::1  # Example IPv6

   channels:
     - "#examplechannel"
   ```

3. **owners.json Example**

   ```json
   {
     "owners": [
       "*!username@hostmask"
     ]
   }
   ```

   Replace `username@hostmask` with the appropriate ident and hostmask of the owners.

4. **data/nicks.json**
   List of nicknames to monitor and capture.

   ```json
   {
     "nicks": [
       "DesiredNick1",
       "DesiredNick2",
       "DesiredNick3"
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Updating Configuration**
   Ensure you customize these files according to your needs. The bot will not run properly without correct configurations.

## Running the Bot

### Development Mode
To run the bot in the foreground for testing and development:

```bash
./gnb -dev
```

### Production Mode
To run the bot as a daemon in the background:

```bash
./gnb
```

Logs will be written to `bot.log` in the project directory.

### Stopping the Bot
To stop the bot, you can send a termination signal:

```bash
pkill -f gnb
```

Or, if running in development mode, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the bot is running.

## Commands

Bot owners can control the bot using commands sent via private messages or in channels where the bot is present.

### Command Prefixes
Commands must start with one of the specified prefixes: `!`, `.`, or `@`.

### Available Commands

- **quit**: Instructs the bot to disconnect from the IRC server.  
  Usage: `!quit`

- **say**: Sends a message to a specified target (channel or user).  
  Usage: `!say <target> <message>`

- **join**: Makes the bot join a specified channel.  
  Usage: `!join <#channel>`

- **part**: Makes the bot leave a specified channel.  
  Usage: `!part <#channel>`

- **reconnect**: Reconnects the bot to the IRC server with a new nickname.  
  Usage: `!reconnect`

- **addnick**: Adds a nickname to the monitoring list.  
  Usage: `!addnick <nickname>`

- **delnick**: Removes a nickname from the monitoring list.  
  Usage: `!delnick <nickname>`

- **listnicks**: Lists all nicknames currently being monitored.  
  Usage: `!listnicks`

- **addowner**: Adds a new owner to the bot.  
  Usage: `!addowner <mask>`

- **delowner**: Removes an owner from the bot.  
  Usage: `!delowner <mask>`

- **listowners**: Lists all current owners of the bot.  
  Usage: `!listowners`

- **bnc**: Manages BNC sessions.  
  Usage: `!bnc <start|stop>`

### Notes

- **Mass Commands**: When executed in a channel, some commands like `join`, `part`, and `reconnect` will be executed by all bots simultaneously.
- **Cooldown**: Mass commands have a cooldown period defined by `mass_command_cooldown` in the configuration to prevent abuse.

## BNC Usage

The bot supports BNC functionality, allowing owners to connect via SSH and interact with the IRC network through the bot.

### Starting a BNC Session
Send the command: `!bnc start`  
The bot will provide connection details privately, including the SSH command to use.

### Connecting to the BNC
Use the provided SSH command, which will look similar to:

```bash
ssh -p <port> <bot_nick>@<vhost> <password>
```

- **port**: The port on which the BNC server is listening.
- **bot_nick**: The nickname of the bot you are connecting to.
- **vhost**: The virtual host or IP address specified in the bot's configuration.
- **password**: The one-time password provided by the bot.

### Interacting via BNC

- **Send Raw IRC Commands**: Type commands as you would in an IRC client.
- **Send Messages**: Use the format `. <target> <message>` to send messages to channels or users.

### Stopping a BNC Session
Send the command: `!bnc stop`  
This will terminate the BNC session for the bot.

## Recent Updates

### Deadlock Prevention (v1.4.0)

We've implemented several improvements to prevent potential deadlocks in the system:

1. **Non-blocking Command Handling**: DCC commands like `listowners` now use timeouts and separate goroutines to prevent blocking the entire system.

2. **Improved Lock Management**: Replaced global lock with read-write locks (RWMutex) in critical components to allow concurrent read operations.

3. **Optimized ISON Processing**:
   - The NickManager now uses timeouts to prevent hanging on ISON requests
   - Better data copying to minimize lock times
   - Using non-blocking goroutines for nick monitoring operations

4. **Timeout Protection**: Added context-based timeouts to prevent indefinite waiting in critical operations.

These improvements ensure the system remains responsive even when multiple owners are connected via DCC and issuing commands simultaneously.
